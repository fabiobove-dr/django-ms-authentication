# django-ms-authentication
A sample user authentication using Microsoft Graph APIs


# How does it work
This is an example of integration between MS Graph APIs and Django.<br>
We use MS suite to enable users to authenticate on our application, and use services that otherwhise wouldn't be available.<br>
For demonstration purpose we have two hidden sections that only authenticated users can reach:
 - Hidden Page
 - Another Hidden Page

# Authentication Application 
The "/ms_authentication" folder contains the django application which manages the user authentication<br>
The "/django_ms_authentication" folder instead is the directory of the whole project<br>

# Lyouts and templates
The lyout of the pages can be modified and is stored in the templates and static directories.<br>
