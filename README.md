# django-ms-authentication
A sample user authentication using Microsoft Graph APIs


# How does it work

This is an example of integration between MS Graph APIs and Django.<br>
We use MS suite to enable users to authenticate on our application, and use services that otherwhise wouldn't be available.<br>
For demonstration purpose we have two hidden sections that only authenticated users can reach:
 - Hidden Page
 - Another Hidden Page
